# Cirucularly-Doubly-Linked-List
Circularly Doubly Linked list in java.          
This is a linked list where after the list ends it starts back at the beggining.                        
Along with that each node in the linked list has a reference to the node in front of and behind it.              
I have provided a test file that will adequality show off the various complex functions to in fact show it is a Cirucularly Doubly linked list.           
Such functions include but are not limited to; adding an item, removing an item, and copying the list to a new list.        
You will have to Compile the Node, Abstract Linked list, and the Linked List file to run the Test file.             
The list itself has a max item size of 10, So if you want to have more items you will have to edit the abstract class
